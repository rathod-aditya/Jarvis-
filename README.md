Jarvis is a Python-based voice assistant that uses speech recognition and text-to-speech to interact with users. It listens for commands like opening Google, YouTube, Facebook, or LinkedIn, and can also play specific YouTube videos. With real-time voice interaction, Jarvis provides a simple AI-driven automation experience.
